# Stock-Data
Extracted financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and did webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data, it is visualized in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks I have worked with are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.
